# Customer Churn Prediction - Telco Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a major issue for subscription-based businesses. This project analyzes customer churn in a telecom company using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict whether a customer will churn based on demographic, contract, and service-related features.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: IBM Telco Customer Churn Dataset
- **Features**: Customer demographics, contract type, monthly charges, total charges, service usage, etc.
- **Target Variable**: `Churn` (Yes/No)

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Customer-Churn-Prediction.git
   cd Customer-Churn-Prediction
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run Jupyter Notebook for analysis:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key insights from the dataset:
- Distribution of churned vs. non-churned customers.
- Impact of monthly charges and contract type on churn.
- Feature correlations and missing value handling.

## 📈 Machine Learning Models
- **Baseline Model**: Logistic Regression
- **Advanced Models**: Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

## 📜 Results
- Key findings from model evaluation.
- Model performance comparison.
- Feature importance analysis.

## 🏆 Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning.
- Deployment using Flask or FastAPI.
- Model interpretability with SHAP.
